I wrote a program to help me generate contraction code.
It convert the latex source code into c source code.
I will write a cuda version in few days.

Now let me show you.


source code:
	convert_split.c --> convert latex code into c source code line by line
	readline.c ==> read file from disk into memory
	test.c --> the main program
	test.tex --> the example input of latex code

We can add these code into our program.
