This is a code-generator under assistant project
------------------------------------------------

	


BUCKUP:
-------
	It's based on python. 
	It generats pure c program.
	Any program can be run directly in python.

	sample.py
	
	case1: 
		doesn't depend on any extra library of std.
	
	case2: 
		depend on some extra library.
		
		case1:	cal function directly.
		case2: 	write function in based std lib.

	
	Then we can conert sample.py to c source code.

	We would need:
		1. a sample txt file that contain some c source code, which would be
			modified by python when refer to it.
		2. a simple interpreter to understand user's input. I define every 
		function as a print function. By calling these function, it would 
		print corresponding code of function. So we actually don't need 
		extra interpreter.
		3. Program should decide what header file should be include. To 
		achieve this, I need every function should be labled by some header
		file. And I should write a function called header to decide what to 
		include.

		Basic functions:
		----------------
			1. operation  "=","+","-","*"
			2. Declare data  int, float, double, char, string, pointer
