This is a code-generator under assistant project
------------------------------------------------

	


BUCKUP:
-------
	It's based on python. 
	It generats pure c program.
	Any program can be run directly in python.

	sample.py
	
	case1: 
		doesn't depend on any extra library of std.
	
	case2: 
		depend on some extra library.
		
		case1:	cal function directly.
		case2: 	write function in based std lib.

	
	Then we can conert sample.py to c source code.

	We would need:
		1. a sample txt file that contain some c source code, which would be
			modified by python when refer to it.
		2. a simple interpreter to understand user's input. I define every 
		function as a print function. By calling these function, it would 
		print corresponding code of function. So we actually don't need 
		extra interpreter.
		3. Program should decide what header file should be include. To 
		achieve this, I need every function should be labled by some header
		file. And I should write a function called header to decide what to 
		include.
		
		4. assist coding. The most importantly, this program should help me
		generating code from begainning rather than just call some function 
		in extra library. It should make programming simpler. To achieve this,
		we need to define some operations which gnerally used and free of bug.
		For example, assignments, declaration, malloc of pointers, realloc of
		pointers, read or write of files. Read line or split line, for loops,
		do while etc. With these basic operations, we can write psedo-code 
		style function and generate ansi c code. 

		Basic functions:
		----------------
			1. operation  "=","+","-","*"
			2. Declare data  int, float, double, char, string, pointer
			3. Declaration of functions
			4. Definition of functions
			5. Definition and usage of structure	

POINTERS:
---------
	This program should ristric our using of pointers to ensure safe.
	Firstly, available operation is restricted;
	Secondly, length of pointers is restricted.
