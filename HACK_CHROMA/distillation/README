Write the ditillation code by myself

Firstly, translate chroma code into QDP++ code

Seocndly, translate QDP++ code into QDP/C code

Last, Write a cuda version of these code.


INVERTER PART:

The most complicated part may be the inverter part. Firstly, I will need a cpu version of inverter. Secondly, I will need a gpu version of inverter.  For gpu, I'd like to use quda as my inverter.


NOTE that translate the complacated case into simple and familar case. For example, I can define some data structure by myself and translate c++ code into ansi c style code.
