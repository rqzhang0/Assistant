				J/Psi-> gamma + eta_c 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We need to caluculate the three point function of this radiative decay process. Note that both J/Psi and eta_c are meson. So we should use the seqsource-meson.ini.xml as input. We need to modify it to satisfy our desired situation.

Fistly, we need to make sure what kinds of SeqSourceType we need to use. Then we can test the sequential source.
