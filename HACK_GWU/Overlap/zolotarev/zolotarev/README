COMPILE:
	bash compile.sh 
Execute the binary:
	./test lmin lmax error n

NOTE that it appriximate the y/sqrt(y^2) and lmin<y^2<lmax. For simplication, I always set lmax=1, so if you want to vary the range of y^2 you should change lmin parameter.

error is the relative diviation error. It always equal to the maximum relative diviation error.

n is the dimension of zolotarev approximation.
